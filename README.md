# Flight Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a dataset containing information about flight ticket prices, including airline, departure and arrival times, journey duration, number of stops, and ticket price.

The goal is to analyze the data and build machine learning models that can predict flight prices, in order to better understand which factors have the greatest influence on pricing.

## 🧠 Data Preparation & Exploration
The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Converting time-based features into numerical formats
- Encoding categorical variables such as airlines and routes
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations to identify patterns

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models
Two regression models are implemented and compared:

- **Linear Regression**  
  A baseline model assuming a linear relationship between features and flight price.

- **Random Forest Regression**  
  An ensemble-based model capable of capturing more complex, non-linear patterns in the data.

## 📊 Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – average prediction error
- **R² Score** – proportion of variance in flight prices explained by the model

Feature importance analysis is also performed to identify which variables most strongly influence ticket prices.

## 🎯 Project Context
This project was completed as part of a **Machine Learning course** and focuses on applying existing machine learning algorithms to a real-world pricing problem.

It complements a separate project where machine learning algorithms were implemented from scratch.
